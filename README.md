# Machine Learning - Activity Recognition
The data is obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/marklvl/activity-recognition-with-healthy-older-people. I combined the several data files into a single file. The data features contained include : Accelerometer readings in G (frontal, vertical, Lateral) The gender of the person being monitored is also included, together with the sensor ID , signal strength, sampling frequency, and finally the activity class that the person is engaged.

1 - Sitting on a bed

2 - Sitting on a chair

3 - Lying down

4 - Ambulating (moving around in the room)

For this dataset, I have used Decision Tree and Random Forrest to predict the activity carried out by people based on Accelerometer readings.
